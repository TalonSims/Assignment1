# Assignment1
# Assignment 1 is a simple HTML and design for week one of CS 290

# I would like to make a website that will tell the story of Curse of Strahd, as played by myself with friends. I have streamed the adventure on my twitch channel, so have plenty of resources to pull from there. My character is also a bard, so it fits thematically. I want to pull inspiration from The Goonies website I stumbled upon, that really does an amazing job of giving the user/reader a great feel for the plot and the characters. With The Goonies website, I learned a lot more than I realized from just watching the film. I want to give the user a wonderful experience that includes a bit of the magic that is involved with Dungeons & Dragons.
